In this game, you play against an AI (very limited) in three different modes.
**[Easy, Normal, Hard]** - Hard mode is very unforgiving.

The player with the highest score (number of matches) is the winner.

# How To Play

When menu options have multiple choices available, click until the option you
want appears.  The option will recycle to the begining of the list once the end
has been reached.  

For keyboard and analog stick players, use the right or left to navigate
between the different choices.  Pressing up and down will navigate between the
different menus.

## Select a Difficulty Level

Choose between three difficulty levels:

* **Easy** - The AI randomly chooses between all the available cards. 
* **Medium** - The AI memorizes the last three moves.
* **Hard** - The AI memorizes every move since the game began.

## Select a Level Map

Currently there are only two available level maps, Katakana and Hiragana.  There are future plans to add numbers
and date/time.
